**#Reimplementation of Figures in "Spatiotemporal co-dependency between macrophages and exhausted CD8+ T cells in cancer"**
This repository contains the code used to reproduce the figures in the paper "Spatiotemporal co-dependency between macrophages and exhausted CD8+ T cells in cancer".

To run this code, you will need the following:
#Python (version 3.6 or higher)
#Jupyter Notebook
#Matplotlib

**#Statistical Tests**
The code uses appropriate statistical tests to test for significance. Specifically, we used a two-tailed t-test with a significance level of 0.05 to compare the 
means of two independent groups. We also used the One-way ANOVA for multiple comparision.

**#Notes**
The data used in this study is not included in this repository. Please refer to the original paper for information on accessing the data.
